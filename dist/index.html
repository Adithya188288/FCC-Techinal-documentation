            Sass is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS. It allows you
            to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all
            with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large
            stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within
            and across projects.

          <p>
            Inorder order to run SASS you need npm installed. You can get npm by
            Installing NODE JS
          </p>
          <p>
            You can download nodejs from this
            <a
              class="link"

              >link</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            After installing node, open a terminal window within the project
            folder in any code editor of your choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inorder to install sass. We have to create a Package.json file. We
            can create a package.json file by running the command
            <em>npm init</em>
          </p>
          <p>Press enter for the all the questions and type <em>YES</em></p>

              In your package.json file, remove the code inside the script tag
              and add the following code. Note we have to create a directory
              called scss and add all the sass files there.

            Here we have created a new script called <em>sass</em>. So from now
            on after you run the script sass and save any changes to your sass
            file. It will automatically compile the changes to and update the
            css file.

          <p>
            Just like we have used variables in CSS. We can use variables in
            Sass also. Please note that the variables in Css and Sass are
            completely different. We use variables to store information.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In Order to use a variables in sass, we have prefix a $ sign.
            </li>

          <p>
            Just imagine you have used the colour yellow throughout the webpage
            without using any variable. If you want to change it, you have to go
            to each section and change it individually. This can become very
            time consuming. But on using a variable, if you change the colour
            assigned to the variable. It will change it throughout the page.
            There is more use of variable than this. We will look into it once
            we understand about mixins.

            When your sass file is kinda long. You can separate the particular
            block of sass code into a separate file using a partial.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To create a partial, the file name has start with an _

            The header.scss in the above example will contain all the style

              But in order to use a partial in the main sass file, we have to

        <article>
          <p>
            Nesting is a pretty simple. We can use sass to nest within our
            selector. It is one of the powerful feature of sass.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For example let’s imagine we have a section with a id = header.
              The section header has a logo with a id of nav-logo and links with
              a id nav-links inside it. So instead of writing CSS like this
            </li>
          </ul>

        <article>
          <p>
            Mixins are awesome. Once you get to understand it, you will never
            let it go. It helps to keep you code DRY. Remember the principle you
            started programming. It means Don’t repeat yourself.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You can use mixins to create a block of code (Called as functions
              in programming) and reuse the same block of code again anywhere in
              the scss file.

          <ul>
            <li>
              In order to use a mixin we have to use the @include keyword. Sass
              variables can be passed as a parameter to a mixin.

        <article>
          <p>
            Extend is one of the easiest functionality which can be understood
            by the end users of sass. It helps us in reusing the css properties
            and helps us in keeping our code DRY
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We can use a % and create a placeholder selector. Sass will not
              compile the style which are not extended. So basically if a
              placeholder selector is created and is not extended then it will
              not reflect in the css file.
            </li>

              <code>

                .black-card
                {
                  @extend card;

              </pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            In the above example sass will extend and add the card css
            properties to the class black-card. But it will not compile the
            %error placeholder to the css file. This helps us in only compiling
            the code needed for the project.

    <nav id="navbar" class="text-center">
      <!-- User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element
         which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation. -->

      <header><h2>Introduction to Sass</h2></header>

      <!-- User Story #10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link.
         There should be one for every element with the class main-section -->

      <!-- User Story #11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar. -->

      <!-- User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header
         text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world"). -->

        the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", 
        the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.-->
